# Modeling and Simulation of Social Systems Fall 2018 – Research Plan

> * Group Name: Freewalk
> * Group participants names: Bircher Lukas, Martin Christoph, Robin Stähli
> * Project Title: Modelling Human Trail Systems and Implementation in a Real World Problem
> * Programming language: Python

## Introduction

The goal is to show that simulations are able to model the real world to some extent. Therefore a model which can simulate human trail systems was built. The model was tested with basic examples also stated in the paper of Dirk Helbing et al., further expanded to a real world park in Alcala, Spain. 
Most of the mathematical model is based on the paper of Dirk Helbing, Joachim Keltsch & Péter Molnàr. It was published in journal Nature in 1997 and is called "Modelling the evolution of human trail systems".

## The Model


(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)

# Reproducibility

(step by step instructions to reproduce your results. *Keep in mind that people reading this should accomplish to reproduce your work within 10 minutes. It needs to be self-contained and easy to use*. e.g. git clone URL_PROY; cd URL_PROY; python3 main.py --light_test (#--light test runs in less than 5minutes with up to date hardware))
